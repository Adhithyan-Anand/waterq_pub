WATER QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM - WIRING DIAGRAM
================================================

1. ARDUINO UNO CONNECTIONS:
---------------------------
- 5V  -> I2C LCD VCC, TDS Sensors VCC, Flow Sensors VCC
- GND -> I2C LCD GND, TDS Sensors GND, Flow Sensors GND, ESP8266 GND
- A0  -> TDS Sensor 1 Signal
- A1  -> TDS Sensor 2 Signal
- D2  -> Flow Sensor 1 Signal (Interrupt 0)
- D3  -> Flow Sensor 2 Signal (Interrupt 1)
- A4/SDA -> I2C LCD SDA
- A5/SCL -> I2C LCD SCL
- D8  -> ESP8266 RX (Software Serial TX)
- D9  -> ESP8266 TX (Software Serial RX)

2. ESP8266 CONNECTIONS:
-----------------------
- VCC -> 3.3V from separate power supply or Arduino 3.3V
- GND -> Arduino GND
- RX  -> Arduino D8 (Software Serial TX)
- TX  -> Arduino D9 (Software Serial RX)
- CH_PD/EN -> 3.3V (to enable the module)
- D1/GPIO5 -> Blue LED (WiFi status) with 220 ohm resistor to GND
- D2/GPIO4 -> Green LED (Data received) with 220 ohm resistor to GND
- D3/GPIO0 -> Yellow LED (Data sent) with 220 ohm resistor to GND

Note: Each LED should have its anode (+) connected to the ESP8266 pin 
and cathode (-) connected to ground through a 220 ohm resistor.

3. 16x2 I2C LCD CONNECTIONS:
----------------------------
- VCC -> Arduino 5V
- GND -> Arduino GND
- SDA -> Arduino A4/SDA
- SCL -> Arduino A5/SCL

4. TDS SENSORS:
--------------
TDS Sensor 1 (Input water):
- VCC -> Arduino 5V
- GND -> Arduino GND
- Signal -> Arduino A0

TDS Sensor 2 (Output water):
- VCC -> Arduino 5V
- GND -> Arduino GND
- Signal -> Arduino A1

5. FLOW SENSORS:
---------------
Flow Sensor 1 (Input flow):
- VCC (Red) -> Arduino 5V
- GND (Black) -> Arduino GND
- Signal (Yellow) -> Arduino D2 (Interrupt 0)

Flow Sensor 2 (Waste flow):
- VCC (Red) -> Arduino 5V
- GND (Black) -> Arduino GND
- Signal (Yellow) -> Arduino D3 (Interrupt 1)

NOTES:
------
1. Use a separate 5V power supply if the current draw exceeds Arduino's capacity
2. ESP8266 operates at 3.3V logic level - if using NodeMCU, it has built-in level shifters
3. Add 10K pull-up resistors to flow sensor signal lines if you experience erratic readings
4. I2C LCD module already has built-in contrast and backlight control
5. I2C address of the LCD is typically 0x27 or 0x3F, change in code if needed
6. Flow sensors may require additional capacitors (100nF) between VCC and GND for stability
7. TDS sensors may require calibration - follow manufacturer's instructions
8. Status LED meanings:
   - Blue LED (D1/GPIO5): ON when WiFi is connected, OFF when disconnected
   - Green LED (D2/GPIO4): Blinks briefly when data is received from Arduino
   - Yellow LED (D3/GPIO0): ON during data transmission, blinks on success, rapid blinks on error
9. If LEDs aren't working, check:
   - LED polarity (longer leg/anode to ESP8266 pin)
   - Resistor values (220-330 ohm recommended)
   - Pin connections match the code (pins D1, D2, D3 on ESP8266)
   - Power supply is sufficient for the ESP8266 and LEDs
